        <h2>8/24: “My Website is a shifting house…” & “A Rant About Technology”</h2>
        <p>The shifting house reading had so many creative metaphors for how to think about the internet that I had never considered. The section talking about social media made me think about how apps are slowly becoming used more than the internet… they say there’s an app for everything these days. Not sure how to feel about it. The rant about technology reading made me rethink what I consider to be technology. It’s not just devices with screens and their accessories, but everything that was created from something else.</p>

        <h2>9/2: “A Handmade Web”</h2>
        <p>I really liked the quote from Kyle Chayka about feeling nostalgic for a time when the internet felt smaller and more close-knit. This is so true especially to people of my generation who grew up on kids space websites like Club Penguin and Webkinz, and those types of spaces don’t really exist for kids today. I also love this last sentence of the article: “The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways.” The rise of AI makes this even more powerful of a statement and choosing to hand-build a website an even stronger form of resistance.</p>

        <h2>9/16: “Rediscovering the Small Web”</h2>
        <p>The sentiment “It reminded me that the creative, personal, fun web I grew up with is not a thing of the past. It’s still here in 2020. You just have to know where to look” really stood out to me. It’s a reminder of how insanely quickly technology and the world is changing. It made me think about how different the internet is now than it was in 2020, even just five years ago, and how almost unrecognizable it is from when it was first created. I enjoyed learning about the history and perseverance of these types of websites today.</p>

        <h2>9/25: “A Friend is Writing”</h2>
        <p>To be honest I had a hard time reading this! All of the popups, sounds, and moving pieces made it pretty overwhelming and stressful, which I’m sure was the intention. I had to read the PDF to be able to focus on the content itself. The discussion of the internet changing the way the conversations exist is super interesting, and one example of that I can think of right away is texting shorthands and how that carries into in-person dialogues.</p>
