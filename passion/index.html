        <h2>Epiphone Hummingbird in Ebony</h2>

        <br>

        <p>I grew up playing mulitple instruments but none of them compare to how much I love to play the guitar! I got my first guitar in 2022 and it was a basic Yamaha starter kit. The first song I taught myself to play was Cherry Wine by Hozier. I do not recommend this as a beginner song! My fingers were numb for weeks. In 2023, I decided to use my birthday money to buy an Epiphone Hummingbird in the color Ebony. I wanted a black guitar, came across this model online, and fell in love.</p>
